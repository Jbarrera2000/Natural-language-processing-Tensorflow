# Natural Language Processing with TensorFlow
This repository contains a collection of natural language processing (NLP) projects built using the TensorFlow framework. The projects include implementation of various deep learning algorithms for text classification, language modeling, and machine translation.

# Projects included
* Text classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
* Language modeling using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
* Machine translation using Sequence-to-Sequence models with attention mechanism
* Named Entity Recognition (NER) using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and Bidirectional LSTMs
* Sentiment analysis using Pre-trained Transformers (BERT, GPT-2)

# Getting started
To get started with this project, you will need to have TensorFlow and other required dependencies installed. Each project is contained within its own directory and includes a README file with instructions on how to run the code.

# Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you find a bug or want to add a new feature, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
